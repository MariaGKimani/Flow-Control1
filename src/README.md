###FLOW CONTROL 1

1. Create a function that prints out all the odd numbers between 1 and 100 
2. Create a function that takes in an array of names and returns the number of
   names longer than 5 characters 
3. You are creating a robot to serve drinks at a party. The robot is required to
   serve a glass of milk for guests under the age of 6. For guests under the age of
   15 but over the age of 6, the robot serves a bottle of fanta orange. Everybody
   else gets a bottle of coca cola. Create a function that will make these
   decisions, printing out the name of the drink each person gets according to
   their age. 
4. Write a function that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. For each
   multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For each multiple of 5, print
   "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and
   5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
